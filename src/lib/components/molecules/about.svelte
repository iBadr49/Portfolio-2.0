    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a Frontend Design and Development student based in Amsterdam, the
      Netherlands. I strive to independently design and develop complex yet
      user-friendly interactive applications for the web that everyone can use.
    </p>

    <p>
      I started making websites in 2021, and in 2022, I pursued a course where I
      could further develop my passion for web design & developement . Since
      then, I have been able to build various websites for myself and for
      others.
